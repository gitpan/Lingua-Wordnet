DESCRIPTION

Lingua::Wordnet gives developers access to Wordnet lexical databases from 
perl. More information about Wordnet is available from 
http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/.


INSTALLATION

Prerequisites are:

	- Wordnet 1.6 source code (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/)
	- Perl5

To build the module, type:

	perl Makefile.PL WNLIB_DIR=/pathtolib WNINC_DIR=/pathtoinc

WNLIB_DIR should specify the location of the libwn.a library. WNINC_DIR 
should specify the location of the Wordnet source code include/ directory.
You can also copy the header files into the local directory.

Makefile.PL will extract the object files from libwn.a, and prepare the
Makefile for the module. You can then type:

	make
	make test
	make install

This will test and install the module.

Note that most configuration options (the path to the database files, etc.) 
can be modified by editing the header files (specifically wnconsts.h).


COMPATIBILITY

The module has been tested only with perl 5.005_03, 5.005_56 on Linux 
2.0.36.


DOCUMENTATION

Existing documentation is withing the Wordnet.pm module; to read type 
'perldoc Wordnet' or 'perldoc ./Wordnet.pm'. For documentation specific to 
Wordnet, see the documentation which accompanies the Wordnet distribution.

Currently the module provides access to a small subset of the Wordnet 
library functions. In the future I may add others. Please let me know if 
you use the module.
